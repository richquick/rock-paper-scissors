# Rock, Paper, Scissors

A simple client-side app to play Rock, Paper, Scissors.

## Tech used

### Main tech
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

### Stack tech
* Jasmine
* Grunt
* Grunt-contrib-jasmine
* Git

## Browser support

The app should work in modern browsers. I've tested it on an iPhone 5, Safari, Chrome etc.

## Notes

* See the github repo history, to see how I built up the app in the early stages.

## Next steps

This in an MVP.

Things I'd like to do next would be:

* Use web sockets with Node or Sinatra back end to allow you to play against other people
* Add option to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
* Increase test coverage on DOM-related elements of the JS
* UI improvements (especially tidying up illustrations, and thinking about more interesting animations)
